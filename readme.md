# A Multi-Tenent Laravel 5.3 CMS

This is a personal project that wasn't concluded. It was pretty much working fine in my tests but there was still many polishing and refactoring to do, so don't use this as a final production system.

If this is something that you're interested please let me know and I'll probably regain interest in working with it again :)
